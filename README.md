# CosmoCraft: Chain Creation Guide

Welcome to CosmoCraft, your go-to solution for creating customizable Cosmos blockchains with ease. This guide will help you navigate the initial steps of creating your Cosmos blockchain using our intuitive UI, focusing on the available customizations.

## Getting Started

Creating a Cosmos blockchain is streamlined with CosmoCraft. Begin by accessing our UI tool, which guides you step-by-step, allowing you to tailor your chain to meet your specific needs.

### Step 1: Chain Basics

- **Chain Name**: Assign a unique name to your blockchain, identifiable across the Cosmos network.
- **Bech32 Prefix**: Select a prefix for generating addresses on your blockchain that reflects your chain's identity.
- **Binary Name**: Specify the executable name for your blockchain's node software, used during node operations.
- **Denomination**: Choose the denomination for your blockchain's native currency, utilized in transactions and balances.
- **Validator Count**: Determine the number of validators to initiate, critical for your chain's consensus and security.

### Step 2: Modules Selection

CosmoCraft leverages a modular architecture, allowing you to select necessary functionalities for your blockchain.

#### Default Modules

Your chain includes essential modules that form the core of most Cosmos blockchains:

- **Staking**: Fundamental for Proof of Stake (PoS) blockchains, it allows token holders to stake tokens for transaction validation.
- **NFT**: Enables the creation and management of Non-Fungible Tokens, applicable to digital art, certifications, and more.
- **Account Keeper**: Manages blockchain accounts, including retrieval and updates.
- **Bank Keeper**: Facilitates token transfers and balance maintenance between accounts.
- **Staking Keeper**: Manages staking logistics including validators, staking tokens, and reward distribution.
- **Mint Keeper**: Responsible for minting new tokens, usually managing native token inflation.
- **Distribution Keeper**: Distributes transaction fee and block provision rewards.
- **Slashing Keeper**: Enforces slashing conditions for validators' misbehaviors.
- **Governance Keeper**: Oversees governance processes like proposal submissions and voting.
- **Crisis Keeper**: Activates during critical conditions to halt the blockchain.
- **Fee Grant Keeper**: Allows one account to cover transaction fees for another.
- **Upgrade Keeper**: Manages blockchain software upgrades.
- **Evidence Keeper**: Handles evidence for misbehaviors, primarily used with slashing.
- **Params Keeper**: Alters network parameters through governance.
- **Capability Keeper**: Ensures object-capability security patterns, often used with IBC.
- **IBC Keeper**: Facilitates Inter-Blockchain Communication for token and data transfer.
- **Transfer Keeper**: Manages IBC token transfers.
- **Authz Keeper**: Permits one account to act on behalf of another.
- **Group Keeper**: Manages group accounts and collective decision-making.

#### Custom Modules

Enhance your blockchain with a selection of advanced modules:

- **Proof of Authority (PoA)**: Suited for permissioned networks where validators are predefined entities.
- **TokenFactory**: Allows the creation and management of various tokens within your ecosystem.
- **GlobalFee**: Implements adjustable network-wide transaction fees.
- **IBC-PacketForward**: Utilizes Inter-Blockchain Communication for cross-chain interactions.
- **CosmWasm**: Integrates Rust-written smart contracts, enabling complex on-chain logic.
- **Wasm-Light-Client**: Supports verification of your chain's state by other blockchain light clients, vital for cross-chain services.
- **Ignite CLI**: A powerful CLI tool to enhance your development and deployment workflows.

#### Coming Soon Modules

We are continually developing new functionalities for CosmoCraft:

- **Liquidity Module**: Supports token swaps and liquidity provisioning.
- **Oracle Module**: Connects external data sources with blockchain operations.
- **Privacy Module**: Enhances transaction privacy using zero-knowledge proofs.
- **Scheduler Module**: Schedules future transactions.
- **Mobile Integration Module**: Extends blockchain functionalities to mobile platforms.
- **Interchain Query Module**: Allows querying of data from other blockchains.
- **Virtual Machine Module**: Supports additional smart contract languages and virtual machines.
- **Marketplace Module**: Manages decentralized marketplaces.
- **Synthetic Assets Module**: Enables creation of synthetic assets on the blockchain.
- **Reputation System Module**: Manages and assigns reputation scores to network participants.

### Step 3: Submission

After configuring your chain, submit your settings through our UI. Our backend will process these configurations and commence the generation of your new Cosmos chain.

# CosmoCraft: Deployment Guide

Post-creation, this guide details the deployment process of your custom Cosmos blockchain with CosmoCraft, including CI/CD, cloud support, validator management, security considerations, testnet setup, and automated testing.

## Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD)

CosmoCraft integrates a robust CI/CD pipeline to automate the build, test, and deployment phases of your blockchain, ensuring it stays up-to-date with the latest code changes and security patches.

### How it Works

1. **Code Pushes**: Pushing code to the main branch of your chain's GitHub repository activates the CI/CD pipeline.
2. **Automated Testing**: The pipeline executes a series of tests to confirm new code does not introduce errors or vulnerabilities.
3. **Deployment**: Successful test results trigger an automatic deployment of updates to your chain, minimizing downtime and maintaining smooth operation.

## Cloud Support

CosmoCraft supports deployment across various cloud platforms, providing flexibility in hosting your blockchain to best meet your needs.

### Supported Platforms
